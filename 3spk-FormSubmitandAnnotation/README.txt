This is a very basic servlet form submit with GET and POST method.
It is not necessary to have both doGet and doPost method.

Also have a simple example of servlet using annotation.(No need to mention in web.xml)
URL change will be redirected to doGet method of the servlet if servlet is present.
Servlet take precedence over the path.
